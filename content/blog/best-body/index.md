I took the most important step in my journey to building my best body before 40. I enrolled in a proper gym last week.

I turned one year @ Sportsbet. To be honest, I had a stressful first year. I had the best support at the company but I think it was just me. I was too anxious at work. I thought stressing out was the norm. I thought getting more hours in will get the work done quicker. But the more stressed I get, I make more mistakes. The more anxious I get. It's a vicious cycle.

I finally took advantage of the company's gym membership perks. Instead of thinking I could not afford it, I thought it is a small price to pay for good health -- which is irreplaceable. I recognise that this the first step. What matters most is what I do with it the following days, months, years.

**The goal is before I turn 40 @ 2020. I am in my best shape ever**

## My mentors

These guys are worth a follow:

1. [Brian Holinka](https://www.instagram.com/bholinka/) - game designer. I found him @ twitter when he posted his amazing transformation @ bodybuilding.com

2. [BJ Gaddour](https://www.instagram.com/bjgaddour/) - ultimate men's health poster boy, works tirelessly, doesn't take himself too seriously.

3. [Jerry Teixeira](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPEAhtSZDkTb0rDGrtaSU7A) - body weight training and overall nice guy.

By surrounding myself with the right people, they will help me achieve my goals faster.
