I reached out to my twitter bros asking for a beginner workout.

They did not disappoint.

My mate [Rob W. James](https://twitter.com/Rob_NBF) of [Nothing Barred Fitness](https://nothingbarredfitness.com/) gave me quick tips through twitter DMs. All done in less than 10 mins.

## How it works

> Pick 1 of each. That's workout A. Do this 3x per week.
>
> After a few weeks of getting used to this, create a different workout using the exercises you didn't pick before.
>
> That's workout B. Keeping the same 3 per week structure, now you can alternate ABA, BAB etc
>
> Start with 3x8 reps on everything.
>
> Add a rep every workout or 2 if you can.
>
> If you hit 3x10, go up in weight and back to 3x8.
>
> There you go. Really simple program. Should work for a good while

I use the concept 2 row machine for a 500km or 5-10 minute warmup -- whichever comes first.

My program officially starts tomorrow.
