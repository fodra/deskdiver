This is a new blogging platform GatsbyJS. Currently a work in progress. If you want to create your own blog using GatsbyJS, below are a few resources that will get you started.

## Gatsby quick start quide

1. [Gatsby.js tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)
2. [Gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)
3. [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io) - Dan Abramovâ€™s blog

I am happy with what I have right now.

Previously, I used Jekyll. I never progressed learning ruby.

Gatsby is a Javascript based static site generator. As a front end developer, I feel right at home writing my blog using Gatsby.

It makes a lot of sense.
