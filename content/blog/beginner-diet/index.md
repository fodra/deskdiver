> When it comes to packing on pounds of pure, unadulterated muscle, diet is the single most important part of your overall bodybuilding program. You can workout all you want, but if your diet isn't in check you will never achieve the physique of your dreams.

When I started reading up on eating right while building muscle, I was utterly confused.

My twitter bros did not help at all. Each one has their own kind of diet.

Thank god the free personal training session I have in my gym gave me a very simple one.

## Guides

Here are two downloadable guides that I follow to answer to basic questions on nutrition:

1. [What do I eat?](./what-should-i-eat-infographic.pdf)

2. [How much should I eat?](./the-best-calorie-control-guide.pdf)

After a week of following these guides, it began to make sense to me that eating a lot more protein and vegetables makes me feel fuller. It eliminates my hunger pangs in between meals. Thus, eliminating my cravings for snacks.
