Today I want to list down the big rocks for 2020.
This is by no means a static list but this is what we're going for this year.

## Dude's new job.

* The motivation behind this is to get dude's ideal job.
* It should be higher paying than the current one.
* Money is not the be all and end all but it is an important factor.
* Why? because we want to get "there" quicker.
* A home deposit for sure is on top of the list.
* The details of the job specifications she's looking for are already determined.
* The only thing is finding the right one.

## Australian Citizenship + Passports

* The bulk of the work was already laid down last year.
* No further action required for us. This is now a waiting game.
* All we need to do is wait for the oath taking schedule.
* Attend with the whole family.
* Once that's done, we'll wait for another few weeks until we can apply for our Australian Passports.
* Which leads us to the next big rock for 2020

## Japan Family Travel

* We have set this goal and budget last year.
* We've set a $12 000 budget for this.
* We have saved up the bulk of this budget with $1 000 to go.
* We still haven't decided for a specific itinerary but that's enough once we have completed our requirements.
* Once we've received our Australian passports, we're ready to book our trip.
* Part of this travel is the possibility of making it a multi-city trip where we can stop by the Philippines so the kids can meet their relatives back home. (Not actually home for us)

## Mama's arrival back in Australia

* We have applied for Mama's visa. We're waiting for approval.
* Mama's a vital part of our household. She takes care of the kids while both of us report to a full time job.
* Mama enables us to have peace of mind while we leave for work.
* Her cooking makes us smile. We want her back! (Read between the lines)

## New Body Plan

* Last quarter of 2019 I have set a goal to be in my best shape ever when I turn 40.
* I am still working on it till now. I have two more weeks to complete my first every muscle building program.
* After my initial program, I will make an assessment on what went well, what did not work and what can I do to improve?
From that review -- I shall make some tweaks and continue building my best body ever!
* I have developed great habits to make this happen.
* Like consistently going to the gym 4x week. Eating well 80% of the time.
* I am confident I will be able to achieve this before my 40th comes.

## Kick Goals @ My job

* This is my second year at work.
* I have been playing it safe for the past year.
* I feel I have warmed up enough and know a lot of people already to navigate my way around work.
* This year, I'd be bolder and take more risks at work.
* Contribute as much as I can so I could move my way up.
* I love working at my current job, and actually enjoying it.
* I want to be a major contributor at my work and take on more responsibilities.
* The goal is to develop the right habits to be in the position where my work will get noticed.
* Have a big impact on the business and in my pocket.
* The more I learn the more I know, the more places I shall go!
