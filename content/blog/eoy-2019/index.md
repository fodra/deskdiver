Less than seven weeks to go until the end of 2019.

Now is not the time to slow down and wait for the year to end.

It's the time to finish strong for the final stretch.

Picking up from my last post, [How do I move up?](https://fodra.github.io/how-do-i-move-up/) I set three things to focus on my career development.

Now I'm going to list down three key areas where I want to focus on my life in general.

## 1. Family & Friends

I'll make sure we'll reconnect with friends and family over the long holiday break.

I don't plan to spend a lot of money during the holidays giving unwanted gifts. I want to spend my time visiting friends during this period.

We have arranged for a road trip to Sydney for about a week. This will be our first time to go there. It will be really good.

## 2. Up skill

Starting this week it will be a great time to pick up some new and helpful skills that I could use to further my career.

I'm thinking picking up some GraphQL and React skills. There's a [site](https://www.howtographql.com/) I booked marked for this purpose.

It will also be beneficial to interact with people who are in the same learning boat.

## 3. New body plan

It's no secret I am on a weight training program. I got myself into the [New Body Plan](https://fodra.github.io/new-body-plan/). I just started this program last week. The end of this program perfectly coincides with the start of the new year 2020.

New year, new body. That's the plan.

I picked up a new way of eating. I also got into the protein powder stuff after workouts. I am lifting progressively.


> These areas are my main focus now and for the year to come. For just an [hour a day](https://www.thecoffeeshoptrader.com/2016/05/work-determines-future-spend-one-hour-per-day-five-things-life-will-change.html), I can make positive changes.
