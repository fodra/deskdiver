This is not the case for me.

This time watching TV -- brought me back to reading books.

What? Is that possible?

Yes. It was because of this:

## Netflix
Inside Bill's Brain `<Decoding Bill Gates>`

* Bill Gates lugs around a shopping bag full of books.

* He takes out a full week off just to be alone with his thoughts and books.

* He's got a shit ton of books in the house -- a personal library. Yeah, that's what it's called.

So what's the book I'm reading right now?

## Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman

I got my copy from the Sportsbet library. I have it on loan.

The challenge for this book is keeping laser focus and make sure I finish what I started.

> Instead of burying my face to social media during my commute and every single time I get my phone, I open my book instead. It's still a form of consuming content but it's more engaging.
