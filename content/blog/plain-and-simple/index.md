He's got simple but very effective advice on men's style.

One of them is keeping it simple by wearing plain and nice fitting t-shirts.

Plain meaning no visible branding.

The cheaper the better. As long as the fit is dialled in.

Spend your money somewhere else like a gym membership or healthy food.

So, here's my top 3 plain shirts that's available locally [Melbourne, Australia].

[3. Uniqlo Supima Cotton Crew Neck (14.90 AUD)](https://www.uniqlo.com/au/store/men-supima-cotton-crew-neck-short-sleeve-t-4143490035.html)

* Super soft

* Available in a wide range of colours

* No logo

* Make sure buy them on sale -- which they currently are. Price goes down to 9.90 AUD

[2. Target Organic Cotton T-Shirt (8.00 AUD)](https://www.target.com.au/p/organic-cotton-t-shirt/62048743)

* Available in a wide range of colours

* Great fit

* Can use your flybuys points to purchase them

* One thing I don't like about these:

* They get de-formed through regular use

[1. Big W B Collection Men's Basic Tee (4.00 AUD)](https://www.bigw.com.au/product/b-collection-men-s-basic-tee-grey/p/831511-grey/)

* This is the best of the bunch.

* Big W is quickly becoming my favourite shop to buy my basics.
