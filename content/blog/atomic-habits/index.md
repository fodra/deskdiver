description: Key take away from the book

I set out a goal in November that I would finish reading a book.

I wasn't able to complete it during the end of November but the first week of December instead.

Good enough for me.

So here's the thing -- I've been goal oriented my whole life and not systems oriented.

The key take away from this book is this:

## If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your systems instead.

To rephrase my statement -- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.

For my other goals:

The goal is not to build a muscle, the goal is to become a body builder.

The goal is not to save up for a holiday to Japan, the goal is to become a traveller.

The goal is not to save up for a home deposit, the goal is to become a home owner.

The goal is not to double my salary, the goal is to become an delivery manager / engineering lead.

Once you associate your goals as being part of your identity, it will be a lot easier to make decisions on a daily basis.
