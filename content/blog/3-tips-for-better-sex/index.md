```
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

- Whitney Houston

## 1. [I masturbate regularly.](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/masturbation)

When I masturbate in the morning, then at night I have sex -- I noticed I last way longer than I would when I don't.

As Ms. Houston sung her lungs out -- learning to love myself is the greatest love of all.

If you learn to love yourself -- as in having sex with yourself, you'll easily translate this to your partner.

Both parties benefit.

A mate of mine discussed this as well on the topic of trying for a baby.

He did it successfully.

He said: if your spunk is sitting there for days and days -- you've got to get rid of it mate!

## 2. [I lift weights.](http://www.executivestyle.com.au/why-training-harder-at-the-gym-equals-better-sex-gjcow9)

Something in lifting weights activates my sex drive. I can carry my weight better when in the act. I can go longer, harder.

I can't recommend going to the gym enough and lift weights.

## 3. [I get more sleep.](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-reasons-why-good-sleep-is-important#section4)

For me this is a great side effect of going to the gym and lifting weights. After a workout -- I sleep better.

In this well rested state, I have more energy, thus performing better.

*This is a first for me. Am I oversharing?*

*Well, I just want to help.
My purpose for sharing this is to help guys out there perform better in bed.*

*Who wouldn't want that!?!*

*If you want to perform better in bed it's as simple as 1, 2, 3.*
