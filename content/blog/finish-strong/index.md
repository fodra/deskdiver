I signed up for a gym membership August 2019. I started slow.

First I only did cardio on the rowing machine -- built my overall endurance and fitness level.

Then I reached out to twitter #gymbros for a [basic full body workout](https://fodra.github.io/beginner-workout/).

I built basic strength and familiarised myself with the gym equipment.

I moved on to the [New Body Plan program](https://fodra.github.io/new-body-plan/) after a few months. I am still going with the program.

I had a few days of bumps along the way as I hurt my back when I started -- I was doing heavy weights with bad form while doing the goblet squat. Then I encountered another foot injury half-way into the program. I got disappointed by the down time.

Thank God, visits to the physio and chiropractor brought me back to the gym. It took a few off days but it was well worth it.

For the last day of 2019, I decided to finish strong.

I put in the work at the gym to close off 2019. I finished week 5 of block 3 for my gym session. I'll take a off loading week at the start of 2020 for a much deserved break.

Overall it has been a good year for me and my family. I encourage everyone to finish strong for 2019. Forget the new year's resolutions.

Do it now and finish the year with a strong note!
